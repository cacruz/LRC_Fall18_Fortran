We introduce the concept of polymorphism in Fortran.
We present in particular:
   - Procedure polymorphism
   - Data polymorphism

In the examples, we use "polygon" as parent class, and "circle",
"rectangle" and "square" (child of "rectangle") as child classes.

The files:

  - test_procedure.F90: shows the procedure polymorphim
  - test_data.F90: shows the data polymorphim

Exercise:
  - In each child class, implement a method that computes the 
    perimeter of a polygon
  - Write a subroutine that takes as argument an arbitrary polygon
    and prints the perimeter of the polygon.
  - Write a simple program that initialzes various polygons and
    calls the above subroutine.
